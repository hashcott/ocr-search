## Coding Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Enable strict mode
- Avoid `any` types when possible
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Use enums for fixed sets of values

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: kebab-case (`user-service.ts`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase (`UserService`)
- **Functions/Variables**: camelCase (`getUserById`)
- **Constants**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_FILE_SIZE`)
- **Types/Interfaces**: PascalCase (`UserProfile`)

### Git Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding missing tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**

```
feat(search): add semantic search functionality

Implement vector-based semantic search using Qdrant.
This allows users to search by meaning rather than keywords.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(upload): handle large file uploads correctly

- Increase timeout for large files
- Add progress indicator
- Fix memory leak in chunking

Fixes #456
```

### Branch Naming

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions or changes

**Examples:**

- `feature/add-ocr-support`
- `fix/upload-timeout-issue`
- `docs/update-api-reference`

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests next to the code they test (`*.test.ts`)
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies

```typescript
describe('UserService', () => {
  describe('getUserById', () => {
    it('should return user when valid id is provided', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const userId = '123';
      const expectedUser = { id: '123', name: 'John' };

      // Act
      const result = await userService.getUserById(userId);

      // Assert
      expect(result).toEqual(expectedUser);
    });
  });
});
```
